1. I am creating a website to promote ITZY's first studio album "Crazy In Love". ITZY is a South Korean girl group and I've been listening to their album nonstop, so I figured I would make a website about it since I am thoroughly obsessed. I am interested in creating it because ITZY's company does not have an official website dedicated to their new album (I found this out when searching for lyrics).

I chose to use mostly fluid because I like the way it looks the best and preserves most of the website looks between screen sizes. However, I could not really figure out how to implement my wireframs exactly as I wanted to hold the left column (images of the members) constant while moving the content on the right between the medium and larger screens. However, I had to rearrange the order that the images were listed in my HTML code, and so I could not figure out how to move the images like I wanted. I was able to make the images have a transition, but they are not in the exact order I wanted.

5. I used the font Rozha One for the title because after looking through literally every single serif Google font, I decided that Rozha One was the most similar to the font used on promotional album covers. Google fonts suggested Roboto as a popular contrast font, so I decided to use it for the content.

6. I used a color dropper to select colors from the album cover (mostly from the words "CRAZY IN LOVE"), then used a tool to select colors that would complement them. I wanted the site to give off the same vibe as the album cover, so that when anyone familiar with the group saw the website, they would know which album it was for.
